Etudi
=====

This project is an umbrella to develop all the tools necessary to study and tech.


Ideas
-----
* A small app interface with limited features and a backend with more features.


Technology
----------

### Interface
Which interface technology should we use? The Kivy and BeeWare have the advantage to be
in the same language of Calibre. But can I use calibre source code as a library? As a 
library I can not, what I would have to do is to extract from the source code. What in 
most cases is very hard because everything that works together have dependencies.

#### BeeWare

##### Pr贸s:
- Python like Calibre.

##### Cons:
- Very new and maybe with little support.
- Calibre does no have an library available to use in loco.

#### Kivy

##### Pr贸s:
- Python like Calibre.

##### Cons:
- Very new and maybe with little support.
- Calibre does no have an library available to use in loco.

#### Flutter

##### Pr贸s
- Good support from Google.

##### Cons
- Not in the same language from Calibre.

#### Native

##### Pr贸s
- The best of the resources from the platform can be use.

##### Cons
- To hard and to expensive to develop on each platform.
